                    <p class="a-paragraph">‘Since I work with a team of creatives, my job is to give them space and
                        confidence to develop their ideas. My goal is to be available to listen, guide, and strengthen
                        them to deliver their best. I’m a big believer in a holistic approach to leadership. Through
                        trust, healthy values and motivation, my ambition is to inspire the team to meet their full
                        potential. Having said that, I also want my team to know that personal life and family always
                        come first.<br><br>On a global scale, family values and expectations towards women to take care
                        of a household often stand in the way of the possibility to pursue a career. Growing up, I
                        didn’t know any female leaders, and I saw women around me fighting hard to be treated as equals
                        at work, especially after having kids. Being a woman and a mother myself, I have not always felt
                        it was okay to stay home with sick children or leave early to pick up the kids from school,
                        either. I remember feeling a lot of pressure to perform as if my family did not exist, and I
                        pushed myself too hard to please.<br></p>
                    <p class="a-paragraph">Now that I am&nbsp;in a position&nbsp;to influence the culture in a team,
                        especially a team with a lot of new parents, it has become my mission to show that there is
                        another way. A healthy work-life balance will free up the energy and creativity we need to
                        deliver on the company goals. The fact that we can have this approach in our workplace is an
                        example of company values set in motion. It also sends a clear signal out there about what is
                        possible. Today, I wouldn’t want to work for a company that doesn’t actively create equal career
                        opportunities for women.<br>&nbsp;<br>My advice to women who aspire to be leaders is to choose a
                        career path they genuinely feel passionate about and trust their gut feeling. But most
                        importantly, to have fun and make friends. Work should be a positive experience, so make sure to
                        enjoy it on the way. I wouldn’t be the same person without the sisterhood I have experienced
                        during my career.’</p>
