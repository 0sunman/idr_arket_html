                <p class="a-paragraph is-richtext">That’s why I think knitwear is so
                    interesting. With woven fabrics there is not as much you can do; the process is always more or less
                    the same and most of it happens at the factory. But a knitted product is carefully designed from the
                    inside out which means we can control the slightest details. There are so many alternative options
                    at all levels of the development, from the diameter of the yarn to how you program the knitting
                    machine, as well as a multitude of possible combinations that will produce very different results.&nbsp;With
                    all these different combinations, we have an opportunity for innovation and refinement season by
                    season. With every new collection, we make small tweaks to the details to improve the quality and
                    sustainability of the garments. In many cases, this is something that you as a customer will not
                    notice. But we put a lot of work into perfecting the fit, feel and performance of our products.</p>

                <p class="a-paragraph is-richtext">In our first collection, in autumn 2017, we
                    introduced knitted jumpers made to sustainable standards from a blend of alpaca, wool, nylon and
                    elastane. It was really beautiful, but it had to be dry-cleaned which of course is not optimal. So,
                    in the following year, we started to investigate how to make it machine washable and replaced virgin
                    nylon with recycled polyester. We were also able to source RWS-certified wool instead of the one we
                    had been using before. We then experienced some problems with pilling and decided to adjust the
                    method of spinning the yarn to make it more stable.</p></div>

                    same, but for next spring we are working with recycled elastane, and within a few years we will be
                    able to produce it from 100 percent sustainable options. The man-made fibres will be recycled while
                    both the wool and alpaca will be certified responsibly sourced.&nbsp;We have made a similar journey
                    with recycled cashmere, which we started working with in our first collection. Back then we could
                    only source pre-consumer leftover yarns from the production of virgin cashmere. It came with many
                    limitations in terms of colours and available quantities, which meant we couldn’t continue using it
                    as we had hoped to. From autumn 2020, we’re collaborating with an Italian supplier which helps us
                    produce a new yarn from recycled post-consumer cashmere and responsible wool. The quality is
                    fantastic.</p>
                <p class="a-paragraph">Season by season, we’re refining our core materials. I see it as our
                    responsibility to become more and more sustainable as we grow bigger, because then these small
                    improvements can really make a difference.’</p>
